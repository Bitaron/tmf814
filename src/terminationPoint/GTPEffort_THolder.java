/**
   * <p>The GTP effort is a statement of the requirement of the list of CTPs
   * that a new GTP. If EFFORT_SAME is specified then the EMS must create the 
   * GTP with the exact same list of CTPs as provided with the GTP creation 
   * request. Further, if the NMS uses EFFORT_SAME, it is assume that the EMS 
   * will not modify the CTP list comprising the GTP at some later point (unless 
   * requested by the NMS via the modifyGTP operation). If EFFORT_WHATEVER is 
   * specified then the EMS may comply with the total bandwidth requirement by 
   * using a different set of CTPs.</p>
   *  
   * <p>If the NMS requests a GTP with gtpEffort equal to EFFORT_SAME, this also 
   * implies that the EMS will not modify on its own, i.e., the EMS will only 
   * modify the GTP if requested by the NMS via the modifyGTP operation.</p>
