/**
   * <p>A CTP/FTP may be involved in zero, one, or many connections. The value
   * TPConnectionState indicates the degree to which a CTP/FTP is used.
   * The values TPCS_SOURCE_CONNECTED and TPCS_SINK_CONNECTED reflect the 
   * presence of a one way connection. The value TPCS_BI_CONNECTED means
   * that the TP is both sink and source connected.</p>
   *
   * <p>When this attribution is used in conjunction with a GTP, it indicates 
   * the TPConnectionState of the contained CTPs. All CTPs within a GTP shall 
   * have the same TPConnectionState. (see 
   * <a href=../../../supportingDocumentation/SD1-3_BundledSNC.pdf >SD1-3 Bundled SNC overview</a>
   * for further information on GTP usage). </p>
   *
   * <p>If an EMS cannot report whether the source of the TP is connected
   * or the sink is connected, TPCS_BI_CONNECTED may be reported by that
   * EMS.</p>
   *
   * <p>The value TPCS_NA is used for PTPs and TPPools.</p>
