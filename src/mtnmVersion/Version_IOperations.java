/**
   * <p>The interface Version_I allows the NMS to query the current version
   * of the IDL interface implemented by the EMS system.
   * In order to use this interface, the NMS needs to invoke the getVersion
   * service to figure out which version of the interface the EMS
   * is providing.  getVersion() should be called by a client before 
   * other communications with
   * an EMS object.  The client can determine from the response string
   * which version of the EMS is available.</p>
   * <p> For details on how to support multiple versions of the IDL see
   * <a href=../../../supportingDocumentation/SD1-43_versioning.pdf >SD1-43 
   * Programmatic Versioning </a>.</p>
   * 
   * <h2> IDL change Process </h2> 
   * <p>Once a change is approved, the EMS and NMS
   * can implement the new changes.</p>

  /**
     * <p>This service returns the version of the IDL that the corresponding 
     * EMS object supports.</p>
     *
     * The format of the return string is as follows:
     * <i>Release</i>.<i>Major</i>[.<i>Minor</i>] where <i>Release</i>,
     * <i>Major</i> and <i>Minor</i> are strings 
     * that contain only digits.
     * 
     * For example, 2.1 indicates release 2 and major release 1, 
     * 1.3 indicates release 1 and major release 3, and so on.
     * Note that x.y has the same meaning as x.y.0 
     * 
     * The minor digit is used for bug fixing the major release.  
     * e.g 1.2.1 is a minor release on 1.2.   
     *
     * Any changes to any IDL files must be approved by the 
     * Specification Authority.
     *
     * For TMF 814 version 2.1, the version is "2.1".
     * For TMF 814 version 3.0, the version is "3_0" or "3.0".
