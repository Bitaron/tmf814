/**
   * <p>This enum identifies the status of a managed element with respect to 
   * current database backup operation.</p>
   * <p>Initially when the EMS is started the Operational status will be set to 
   * COS_Idle.</p>
   *
   * <p>The current operation status values are defined as follows:<p>
   * <ol>
   * <li>COS_Idle: no database backup operation has been performed since EMS 
   * last (re)started (boot).</li>
   * <li>COS_Pending: a backup operation has been requested but has not yet 
   * started.</li>
   * <li>COS_InProgress: a backup operation is being performed.</li>
   * <il>COS_Completed: last backup operation was successful.</li>
   * <il>COS_Aborted: last backup operation failed.</li>
   * </ol><br>
