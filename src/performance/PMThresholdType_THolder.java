/**
   * <p>Describes threshold types (watermark levels) for TCA parameters.</p> 
   * 
   * <p>The TWM_HIGH and TWM_HIGHEST types are used for TCAs that are raised 
   * when the measured value goes above the threshold. The TWM_LOW 
   * and TWM_LOWEST types are used for TCAs that are raised when the 
   * measured value goes below the threshold (only apply to gauges).</p>
   *
   * <p>When there is only one level of TCA trigger, only TWM_HIGH and/or 
   * TWM_LOW are used. When there are two levels of TCA triggers, 
   * TWM_HIGHEST and/or TWM_LOWEST are used in addition.
   * </p>
   *
   * <p>See <a href=../../../supportingDocumentation/SD1-37_TCAs.pdf >SD1-37 PM Threshold Types</a>
   * for information on how water mark levels are used.</p>
