   * <p>A route for an SNC is defined as a partially ordered list of cross-
   * connects.</p>
   *
   * <p>This structure can deal with any arbitrarily complex protection paths
   * made up from connection types described in
   * <a href=../../../supportingDocumentation/SD1-36_SNCTypes.pdf >SD1-36 SNC Types</a>.</p>
   * 
   * <p>The cross-connects are listed from the NE 
   * on which the SNC starts (first entry) to the NE on which the SNC ends
   * (last entry). There is no mandatory order in
   * the cross-connects listed in between the first one and the last one.</p>
