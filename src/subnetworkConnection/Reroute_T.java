/**
   * <p>The Reroute_T type indicates if the EMS/Mes/Control Plane are allowed 
   * and/or required to reroute this SNC if there 
   * is a failure on this SNC, periodically to optimize the routes, of for any 
   * other reason. This can be done either using network routing protocols or
   * through centralized management..</p>
   *
   * <p>The RR_NO value means that the EMS/MEs/Control Plane are not allowed to
   * reroute the 
   * SNC. The RR_YES value means that the EMS/MEs are allowed to reroute the SNC 
   * and required to attempt to reroute it upon failure.
   * The RR_NA value is used when the NMS does not want to specify the exact EMS 
   * behaviour. In this case it is left up to the EMS/MEs/Control Plane to
   * decide whether rerouting will be provided. It is also used if the
   * EMS/Mes/Control Plane are allowed to 
   * reroute the SNC but not required to attempt to reroute it upon failure.</p>
